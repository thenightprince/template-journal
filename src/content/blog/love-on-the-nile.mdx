"Kiria-Suun-Amun..."

Watching the delicate syllables depart from your lips,
I fell into rhythm with each tumbling curve.
Sweet ambrosia crashed against my yearning eardrums,
your tongue was a sway of treble and tremor

In desperation, I turned the hourglass of my memory
even as the last whisper escapes your sweet mouth
to live eternal the gift of your revelation
as at last you grant me the courtesy of your name
