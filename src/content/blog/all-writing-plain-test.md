GISSEL

black eyes
set deeply upon
the pallid arch
of each cheek

framed by hair
the color of night
reflecting naught
of this moonset glow

delirium touched mind
and an equally dark heart
my soul is stirred by this
most debased amalgam

forgive me
my forsaken sensibility
for I could never be
more in love

GYM CRUSH

i want no existence
in a universe
where i cannot covertly
track the gains
of my gym crush
via social media


---

FINAL CHAPTER

closing this final chapter
of romantic prose
i pause before extinguishing the light
to gaze upon you while peacefully asleep
and relent once more to wicked imaginings
abandoning our vows
if only for the slightest moment
and dare to conjure
some pale simulacrum
of a chained Andromeda
or caged Rapunzel
to shape you as my imperiled maiden
and ideal archetype of ancient melodrama
though as you stir and wake
i reluctantly concede that
despite my reckless thoughts
i cannot fancy you skulking haplessly
amidst these tattered verses
for you are no ordinary
damsel in distress


---

THE NEXT PLACE

i smile through the tears
and imagine you are both
best of friends now
in the life after this

loving mother laughing sweetly
at the half-hearted attempt
to capture an agile
and cleverly mocking bird

adored pet weaving an ebony form
among the stalks of corn
and peas in their pods
growing against the back wall

both in comforted peace
waiting to rejoin their loved ones
in the garden they share
and have been patiently tending


---


WAITING

Waiting for you
Is effortless
When each thought
Is a sweet daydream

As you approach
I lift my eyes
From the last page
And delight
In the dissymmetry of
Your mischievous smile

LOVE ON THE NILE

"Kiria-Suun-Amun..."

Watching the delicate syllables depart from your lips,
I fell into rhythm with each tumbling curve.
Sweet ambrosia crashed against my yearning eardrums,
your tongue was a sway of treble and tremor

In desperation, I turned the hourglass of my memory
even as the last whisper escapes your sweet mouth
to live eternal the gift of your revelation
as at last you grant me the courtesy of your name

So my gym crush and I have the best unspoken relationship rules:

Allowed:
Awkward, not-so-random sustained eye contact.
Using each other's presence to fuel our workouts.

Forbidden:
Making actual conversation.
Making actual conversation with any other gym member of the opposite sex.
Having a backup gym crush.
Speaking to other gym members about US and what WE have.

Currently Awaiting Approval:
Using any combination of Google or public record search, cross referenced social media platform database discovery or reverse image search to learn more about each other because, after all, these types of relationships are built and grown on a foundation of mutual admiration and trust.

Aren't we the greatest?!

Fifty Shades of Greys


Bellastasia Fawn narrowed her eyes against the clinical glare of the overhanging lamp, slowly releasing the breath that she had taken in almost a minute earlier. She attempted to raise a hand in front of her face but to no avail. Her neurons gave commands that her muscles would not obey, regardless of her willpower. She feigned another attempt, if only to fool herself into believing she wanted to struggle against the invisible bonds. She knew, as before, that movement was a luxury granted to her only if she was compliant. Thankfully, blind obedience had never been her strength.

Her pale skin felt bare against the odd, metallic-plastic alloy that comprised the familiar, rectangular platform she lay upon. Her modesty was only just spared by the paper-thin wisp of linen that concealed just enough to prevent her from blushing. She had long stopped questioning why THEY didn't just allow her to remain in whatever fashion of nightgown she had worn to bed. Was it some form of control? Did THEY realize that by now the control was unnecessary? It shamed her to admit it. This shame and control was just more confirmation that she had once again been TAKEN. She sighed defiantly - full in the knowledge that she was once again back aboard THE CRAFT.

The lamp dimmed, and on cue, as each time before, she felt the presence of THEM - always in their group of three, always positioned at her head, feet and side. As her eyesight began to adjust, she recognized the one poised directly above her - she had referred to him as Mr. Alien Grey. His lidless eyes had always seemed to hold a modicum of false compassion and authority absent in his companions. Had he ever spoken, she imagined that he would have given her words of comfort and veiled commandment as his stewards performed their assigned set of EXPERIMENTS.

Instead, staring into the perfect blackness of his oval eyes, she felt the familiar sensation of his universal sentience as it descended and permeated her mind, assuring her that she was SPECIAL â€“ that she was reserved for an otherworldly purpose he was not willing to disclose. Never had the experiments been physically invasive. The companions had always moved their frail, colorless hands above the length of her body, pausing periodically above her abdomen. She knew instinctively, as a woman, that they were trying once more to gift her womb with some hybrid abomination.

After a time, Mr. Alien Grey tilted his head ever so slightly and motioned for the companions to discontinue their methodical attempts, no doubt frustrated at the repeated inability to seed her. Bellastasia took a small victory in this, as she had the times before. She steadily projected her ardent refusal at becoming implanted if she remained an unwilling conscript. She would have answers first, all the answers.

Mr. Alien Grey placed his thin hands upon each side of her head, the only contact she had ever been granted by the visitors. Her skin tingled and itched as his fingers traced over her temples in a practiced pattern that always preceded a benign coma. She stared into his eyes with her remaining awareness and projected images of defiance before finally managing a wry grin as each wave of unconscious bliss began to pull her further from the celestial shore of any known reality.

Soon she would awaken in her own bed, more steadfast in her resistance and resolute in her desire to doom the intruders.

drown me
in the bottomless pool
of your neglect

THE STAR SPAWN

As I lay here with my dearest Cassia, now fast asleep upon my chest, my thoughts drift across an ocean of desperation. It has been forty days since the entrance to the vault was sealed shut behind us, and the failure of these last rounds of experiments have me quietly unnerved.

Cassia, ever the optimist, yet believes that some iteration of our approach will reveal a successful divination. Indeed, I am heartened to see that she has shown little sign of her previous squeamishness and assists me in even the most macabre of rituals without wilting. For this, I should be thankful, yet more often of late my narrow and judging eyes have betrayed my growing irascibility at her presence.

Now, when she suggests a variation upon our latest failed cantrip, I am quick to wound her with an exacting and arbitrary deconstruction of her analysis. Monster that I am, the flash of hurt across her face at my stiff rebuke pains me much less than each additional miscarriage of these damnable incantations.

If I were a more amiable companion, I would encourage whatever naive hope she continues to offer me. I would praise each alteration in the measure and beat of her words and proffer a more tender acceptance of her contribution instead of pure and creeping resentment. Now, I cannot help but silently lament as I descry her every barren invocation. Each attempt is more futile than the last, wearisome beyond even my tolerance, slowly and unfairly eroding the warmth I once felt for her stewardship.

Even our nightly lovemaking has become a slow rhythmic pattern of uninspired labor.

By some blessing, Cassia appears largely unburdened by the mounting failures and still looks to me for steadfast guidance and faithfulness. She must have trust in both my duty and capability. As such, I will muster the endurance for one final day of this false devotional bravado.  Still, I worry outwardly for her sanity. Even the most resolute mind is eventually withered to the point of madness by the sheer number of dark oaths and vile declarations that must be sworn equally from spirit and tongue. Yet, I have managed to remain relatively immune, though troubled cogitation threatens to corrupt the limits of my reasoning.

This undoubtedly ignoble endeavor is evermore a casualty of my suffering memory, its true purpose lost within a listless and wandering haze, moving ever closer to the periphery of my subconscious. These journal entries have served intent well enough, and recent mornings have found me searching each tattered page and hasty scrawl of calligraphy for some semblance of reality upon which to moor the remnants of my sanity.

Inescapably, I am becoming acutely aware of a familiar emotion welling up inside me; a silent and cruel indifference toward my loyal and gentle Cassia. I have kept two secrets from her. First, that she has not been my first consort within these walls.  Second, that the innocent blood under her pale and delightful skin has been the only ingredient needed for this undertaking.

Were I capable of finding virtue in love or merit in the single-mindedness of her blind obedience, I would be tempted to allay her fears and ask for some modicum of forgiveness, however, I have a duty to the purity of the blood. Only in the fleeting moment of her final, distressed recognition would the blood achieve its fantastic potential, and to corrupt it beforehand would only delay the expected.

Cassia stirs within my embrace and for an instant I fear that my thoughts were put to voice, but no. It must be near midnight now, and a peaceful, knowing stillness has befallen our bedchamber like a funeral veil. I lean forward and softly kiss her forehead and run my fingers through the dark auburn coils of her hair. Though no authentic act of kindness, I make a silent plea in hopes that she is not wholly consumed by the forthcoming consecration.

There is no answer but the gentle sigh and soft warmth of her breath.

Sleep sweetly, my dearest Cassia.

MOROCCO


Oh, my sweet and most pure Queen!
My heart is awash in the splendor of the dawn,
for you have called me your King!

I am sustained by these thoughts of you,
of endless, requited love across a distance.
The wind carries the sweet lullaby of your voice,
my beautiful, radiant songbird of the Rabat-Sale.

I call out to the sun and moon and stars
to keep watch over you when my eyes dare to stray.
I pray for the gods both old and new, obscured and forgotten,
to join our wandering souls in the realm of dreams.

Let us journey forth, hands locked in sweet embrace,
bound by an inevitable and most divine consummation.
Grant me the gift of your royalty, oh my dearest Soul,
my rarest blossom in the Valley of the Roses.

Let me be your earth, let my joyful tears be the rain
that falls upon the softly rolling hills of your form.
Let me reap the infinite bounty of your sweet fruit
as I am ravenous for the nourishment of your lips.

Oh, my sweet and most pure Queen!
Let my ecstasy be the morning dew
that kisses your petals before each new dawn.
