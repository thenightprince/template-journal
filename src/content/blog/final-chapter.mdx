closing this final chapter
of romantic prose
i pause before extinguishing the light
to gaze upon you while peacefully asleep
and relent once more to wicked imaginings
abandoning our vows
if only for the slightest moment
and dare to conjure
some pale simulacrum
of a chained Andromeda
or caged Rapunzel
to shape you as my imperiled maiden
and ideal archetype of ancient melodrama
though as you stir and wake
i reluctantly concede that
despite my reckless thoughts
i cannot fancy you skulking haplessly
amidst these tattered verses
for you are no ordinary
damsel in distress
