Oh, late winter night,
will your cold and restless winds
carry my quiet confession—
this rekindled longing—
to the far side of the world?
Can you promise they will travel
unscattered, unbroken,
through shadowed valleys and nameless peaks,
across the vast, unyielding space
that stretches between our hearts?
I need my first love to hear
the unspoken echo between the words—
those memories of young desire,
marked by fleeting moments
of trembling closeness,
when I dared to hold her
and press an innocent kiss upon her lips.
Please, let the distance not hush my meaning,
as time has failed to quiet my longing.
For I ache to hear the answer
to the only question that remains:
"What are we waiting for now?"
