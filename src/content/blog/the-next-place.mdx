<mark>i smile through the tears</mark>

and imagine you are both

best of friends now

in the life after this


loving mother laughing sweetly

at the half-hearted attempt

to capture an agile

and cleverly mocking bird


adored pet weaving an ebony form

among the stalks of corn

and peas in their pods

growing against the back wall


both in comforted peace

waiting to rejoin their loved ones

in the garden they share

and have been patiently tending
