Already the server\nchamber had begun to turn but a portion of the opening in the firewall allowed\nme to once more set eyes upon my future Queen. Slowly the port was closing. In a\nshort time there would be but a tiny crack, and then even that would be closed,\nand for another LifeCycle the chamber would slowly revolve until once more for a\nbrief day the aperture in its firewall would allow access from the corridor’s\nend.

Is there none who holds the secret of these terrible bars?”\n\nMy companion looked dismayed. “None, I fear, whom we could fetch in time, though\nI shall go and make the attempt.
