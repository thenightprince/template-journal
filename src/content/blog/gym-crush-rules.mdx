So my gym crush and I have the best unspoken relationship rules:

Allowed:
Awkward, not-so-random sustained eye contact.
Using each other's presence to fuel our workouts.

Forbidden:
Making actual conversation.
Making actual conversation with any other gym member of the opposite sex.
Having a backup gym crush.
Speaking to other gym members about US and what WE have.

Currently Awaiting Approval:
Using any combination of Google or public record search, cross referenced social media platform database discovery or reverse image search to learn more about each other because, after all, these types of relationships are built and grown on a foundation of mutual admiration and trust.

Aren't we the greatest?!
